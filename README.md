# Elm support for Visual Studio Code

Elm needs a good IDE. So let's extend VS Code and make developing in [elm](http://elm-lang.org) even more enjoyable. 

## Current features

* Syntax highlighting
* [Snippets](snippets/elm.json)

## Todo

* Autocompletion 
* Add more useful code snippets
* Refactoring support

## Help wanted

Building all these things will take some time. So pull requests are much appreciated!
